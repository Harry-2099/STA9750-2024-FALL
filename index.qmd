## Introduction

Hello, I'm Harry and welcome to my first github pages website. I promise I'm not insane I just wanted to graph something and went with this is corny joke. I am in a MS in Statistics and Data Science program, coming from a business background. My decision to pursue this degree stemmed from my desire to learn the intricacies involved in modern stats and their applications.Topics that particularly excite me are Machine and Statistical Learning as well as the application of these to financial and economic problems.
