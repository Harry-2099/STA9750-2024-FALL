## About Me

Hello, I'm Harry and welcome to my github pages website. Here you will be able to look at some of the projects I've completed as well as my CV. Currently, I am in the MS in Statistics and Data Science program at Baruch. My decision to pursue this degree stemmed from my desire to learn the intricacies involved in modern stats and their applications. Topics that particularly excite me are Machine and Statistical Learning as well as the application of these to problems in finance, economics, and tech.
